# Wall-E

A bot that monitors and manages your pull requests by ensuring they are merged when they're ready and don't stack up in your repository 🤓

### Motivation

Pull Requests are conceptually asynchronous and they go through a series of iterations until they are finally ready to be merged which not always happens when we are expecting, we can be waiting for CI to test it, waiting for a review, ... 

That can lead to the pull request staying in the repository for longer than it needs to be and potentially stacking up with other pull requests making the integrations more time consuming and challenging.

### The notion of ready

Pull Requests should meet a specific set of criteria before being merged.

- Be in sync with the base branch
- Be reviewed and approved by a minimum number of reviewers
- Have all checks passing

Depending on the workflow of each team some of them may be disabled to suit their needs.

### How?
